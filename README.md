# FSX-AI-Scheduler
Add-on for FSX that allows to manage the IA of a specified airport.

-First project of these kind, in these case, the objective of the project is recreate the real operations of an airport into the simulator using the tools provided by the Microsoft's SDX that comes with the game and merging these tools with the great number of aircraft provided by the instalation of the IVAO's MTL for the multiplayer gaming.
The way of combine these two options is the fact that it's possible to change the aircraft available in the fs10.AircraftTypes.csv file and add to these file the MTL aircraft, which is indexed as useful in the fsx.cfg file. By these way you can obtain new planes in the environment of the simulator, but only for the IA; allowing that to not disturb in the "Aircraft Selection" menu.
